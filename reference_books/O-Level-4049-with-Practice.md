# CHAPTER 1: QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Quadratic Equations
- **Standard form**: ax² + bx + c = 0 where a ≠ 0
- **Roots/Solutions**: Values of x that satisfy the equation

### Methods of Solving
1. **Factorization** (if ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0)
2. **Completing the square**
3. **Quadratic formula**
4. **Technology**

## ESSENTIAL FORMULAS

### The Quadratic Formula
```
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
```

### Completing the Square
```
ax² + bx + c = a(x + b/2a)² + (c - b²/4a)
```

### The Discriminant (Δ)
```
Δ = b² - 4ac

If Δ > 0: two distinct real roots
If Δ = 0: one repeated real root (equal roots)
If Δ < 0: no real roots (complex roots)
```

### Sum and Product of Roots
For ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots α and β:
```
α + β = -b/a
αβ = c/a
```

## QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS

### Vertex Form
```
y = a(x - h)² + k

where (h, k) is the vertex
```

### Finding Vertex
```
x-coordinate of vertex = -b/2a
y-coordinate = f(-b/2a)
```

### Axis of Symmetry
```
x = -b/2a
```

### Using Quadratic Functions as Models
- Applying quadratic functions to real-world situations
- Finding maximum/minimum values in context

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 1 (2023 Mock - Nature of Roots):**

(a) Find the range of values of k for which (k-3)x² + 4x + k is always positive for all real values of x. [2]

(b) Show that the roots of the equation 6x² + 4(m-1) = 2(x + m) are real if m ≤ 2 1/12. [2]

**Answers:**
(a) k > 4
- For (k-3)x² + 4x + k > 0 for all x: discriminant < 0
- 16 - 4k(k-3) < 0
- k² - 3k - 4 > 0
- (k-4)(k+1) > 0
- k > 4 or k < -1
- Since k-3 > 0, k > 3
- Therefore k > 4

(b) Shown
- 6x² + 4(m-1) = 2(x + m)
- 6x² - 2x + 2m - 4 = 0
- Discriminant = 4 - 48m + 96 = 100 - 48m
- For real roots: 100 - 48m ≥ 0
- m ≤ 2 1/12 ✓

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- a > 0: parabola opens upward (minimum point)
- a < 0: parabola opens downward (maximum point)
- y-intercept occurs at (0, c)
- Conditions for line to intersect, be tangent to, or miss the curve involve discriminant

---

# CHAPTER 2: EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES

## QUADRATIC INEQUALITIES

### Method 1: Graphical Approach
- Sketch parabola y = ax² + bx + c
- Identify critical values (roots)
- Read solution from graph

### Method 2: Sign Diagram
1. Find and mark critical values on number line
2. Test sign in each interval
3. Select intervals where inequality is satisfied

## RATIONAL INEQUALITIES

Form: (ax + b)/(cx + d) > 0, <, ≥, ≤

**Steps:**
1. Find critical values (numerator = 0, denominator = 0)
2. Create sign diagram
3. Test each interval
4. Select intervals satisfying inequality
5. Note: exclude values where denominator = 0

## SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
- One linear, one quadratic

---

# CHAPTER 3: SURDS

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Surd Definition
- **Surd**: Root of a number that cannot be simplified to remove the root sign
- **Like surds**: Surds with the same radical part

## OPERATIONS WITH SURDS

### Rules
```
√a × √b = √(ab)
√a / √b = √(a/b)
(√a)² = a
```

### Rationalizing the Denominator

**Case 1: Single surd**
```
1/√a = √a/a
```

**Case 2: Sum with surd**
```
1/(a + √b) = (a - √b)/(a² - b)
1/(√a + √b) = (√a - √b)/(a - b)
```

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 2 (2023 Mock - Surds):**

Express (√5+√3)/(√5-√3))² in the form a + b√15, where a and b are integers. [2]

**Answer:**
31 + 8√15

Solution:
```
(√5+√3)/(√5-√3))²
= (5 + 2√15 + 3)/(5 - 2√15 + 3)
= (8 + 2√15)/(8 - 2√15)
= (8 + 2√15)/(8 - 2√15) × (8 + 2√15)/(8 + 2√15)
= (64 + 32√15 + 60)/(64 - 60)
= (124 + 32√15)/4
= 31 + 8√15
```

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- √(a²) = |a| not just a
- Can't simplify √(a + b) to √a + √b
- Rationalize denominators before calculating
- Check for simplification: √8 = 2√2

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 5 (2023 Mock - Polynomial):**

(a) Factorise completely 27a³ - 125b³. [2]

(b) It is given that 3x³ + 3x² - 11x - 6 when divided by x + a has a remainder that is half the remainder when it is divided by x - a.
    (i) Show that 3a³ - a² = 11a - 2. [2]
    (ii) Solve 3a³ - a² = 11a - 2, giving your answer to two decimal places where necessary. [3]

**Answers:**

(a) (3a - 5b)(9a² + 15ab + 25b²)
- 27a³ - 125b³ = (3a)³ - (5b)³
- Using a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

(b)(i) Shown
- Let f(x) = 3x³ + 3x² - 11x - 6
- f(-a) = -3a³ + 3a² + 11a - 6
- f(a) = 3a³ + 3a² - 11a - 6
- Given: f(-a) = ½f(a)
- -3a³ + 3a² + 11a - 6 = ½(3a³ + 3a² - 11a - 6)
- Solving gives 3a³ - a² = 11a - 2 ✓

(b)(ii) a = 2, 0.18, or -1.85
- 3a³ - a² - 11a + 2 = 0
- (a - 2) is a factor
- (a - 2)(3a² + 5a - 1) = 0
- a = 2 or a = (-5 ± √37)/6
- a = 2, 0.18, or -1.85

## ZEROS, ROOTS, AND FACTORS

### Relationships
- If P(a) = 0, then:
  - a is a zero of P(x)
  - a is a root of P(x) = 0
  - (x - a) is a factor of P(x)

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- Number of roots ≤ degree of polynomial
- Sum of roots = -b/a for degree 2
- Product of roots = (-1)ⁿ(constant term)/(leading coefficient)

# CHAPTER 5: PARTIAL FRACTIONS ⭐ NEW CONTENT

## DEFINITION

Partial fractions (or partial fraction decomposition) is a method of breaking down a complex rational function into simpler fractions that are easier to integrate or work with.

**Key Principle:**
A rational function with a polynomial denominator can be decomposed into simpler fractions.

## REQUIREMENTS

For partial fraction decomposition to work:
1. The fraction must be **proper** (degree of numerator < degree of denominator)
2. If not proper, perform **polynomial long division** first
3. The denominator must be **factorable**

## THE THREE CASES

### CASE 1: DISTINCT LINEAR FACTORS

When denominator has factors like (ax + b)(cx + d)...

**Form:**
```
P(x)/[(ax+b)(cx+d)] = A/(ax+b) + B/(cx+d)
```

**Method:** Substitution method (usually faster)

**Example:**
Express (5x+1)/[(x-1)(x+2)] as partial fractions

Solution:
```
(5x+1)/[(x-1)(x+2)] = A/(x-1) + B/(x+2)

Multiply both sides by (x-1)(x+2):
5x + 1 = A(x+2) + B(x-1)

Substitute x = 1:
5(1) + 1 = A(1+2) + 0
6 = 3A
A = 2

Substitute x = -2:
5(-2) + 1 = 0 + B(-2-1)
-9 = -3B
B = 3

Answer: (5x+1)/[(x-1)(x+2)] = 2/(x-1) + 3/(x+2)
```

### CASE 2: REPEATED LINEAR FACTORS

When denominator has repeated factors like (ax + b)²

**Form:**
```
P(x)/[(ax+b)²] = A/(ax+b) + B/(ax+b)²

P(x)/[(ax+b)²(cx+d)] = A/(ax+b) + B/(ax+b)² + C/(cx+d)
```

**Method:** Substitution + Equating Coefficients

**Example:**
Express (3x+5)/[(x+1)²] as partial fractions

Solution:
```
(3x+5)/[(x+1)²] = A/(x+1) + B/(x+1)²

Multiply by (x+1)²:
3x + 5 = A(x+1) + B

Substitute x = -1:
3(-1) + 5 = 0 + B
2 = B

Substitute x = 0:
5 = A(1) + 2
A = 3

Answer: (3x+5)/[(x+1)²] = 3/(x+1) + 2/(x+1)²
```

### CASE 3: IRREDUCIBLE QUADRATIC FACTORS

When denominator has quadratic factors that don't factor (like x² + 1)

**Form:**
```
P(x)/[(ax+b)(x²+c)] = A/(ax+b) + (Bx+C)/(x²+c)
```

**Key:** Numerator over quadratic is linear (Bx + C), not just constant

**Example:**
Express 1/[(x-1)(x²+1)] as partial fractions

Solution:
```
1/[(x-1)(x²+1)] = A/(x-1) + (Bx+C)/(x²+1)

Multiply by (x-1)(x²+1):
1 = A(x²+1) + (Bx+C)(x-1)

Substitute x = 1:
1 = A(2) + 0
A = 1/2

Expand and equate coefficients:
1 = Ax² + A + Bx² - Bx + Cx - C
1 = (A+B)x² + (C-B)x + (A-C)

Coefficient of x²: 0 = A + B → B = -1/2
Constant term: 1 = A - C → C = -1/2

Answer: 1/[(x-1)(x²+1)] = 1/[2(x-1)] + (-x/2 - 1/2)/(x²+1)
```

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 5(c) (2023 Mock - Partial Fractions):**

Express (4x³ + x² + 6)/[(x-2)(x²+2)] in partial fractions. [4]

**Answer:**
4 + 7/(x-2) + (2x-4)/(x²+2)

Solution:
```
4x³ + x² + 6 = 4(x-2)(x²+2) + A(x²+2) + (Bx+C)(x-2)

Substitute x = 2:
32 + 4 + 6 = A(6)
A = 7

Substitute x = 0:
6 = -16 + 2(7) + C(-2)
C = -4

Compare x²:
1 = -8 + 7 + B
B = 2

Therefore: 4 + 7/(x-2) + (2x-4)/(x²+2)
```

## METHOD SUMMARY

**Steps for Partial Fractions:**

1. **Check if proper fraction** - if not, do polynomial division
2. **Factor denominator** completely
3. **Set up form** based on factor types (distinct linear, repeated, or irreducible quadratic)
4. **Find unknowns** using:
   - Substitution method (substitute convenient x values)
   - Equating coefficients method (expand and compare coefficients)
   - or combination of both
5. **Write final answer**

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- Each repeated factor (x-a)² requires separate terms for (x-a) and (x-a)²
- Irreducible quadratic denominators get linear numerators (Bx + C)
- Always verify answer by adding fractions back together
- Partial fractions are essential for integration of rational functions
- Practice changing signs when denominators have (a-x) form

```

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 6 (2023 Mock - Binomial Theorem):**

(a) By considering the general term in the binomial expansion of (kx - 1/x³)⁷, where k is a constant, explain why there are no even powers of x in this expansion. [3]

(b) Given that the coefficient of the third term is thrice the coefficient of the second term, find the value of k. [3]

**Answers:**

(a) General term = ⁷Cᵣ(kx)⁷⁻ʳ(-1/x³)ʳ = ⁷Cᵣk⁷⁻ʳ(-1)ʳx⁷⁻⁴ʳ
    Power of x = 7 - 4r = 2(3 - 2r) + 1, which is always odd.
    Therefore, there are no even powers of x.

(b) k = -1
    - ⁷C₂(k)⁵(-1)² = 3 × ⁷C₁(k)⁶(-1)¹
    - 21k⁵ = -21k⁶
    - k = -1

## SPECIAL CASES

### (1 + x)ⁿ
```
(1 + x)ⁿ = 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2!)x² + ...
```

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- Middle term in binomial expansion has largest coefficient
- Sum of all coefficients = 2ⁿ (substitute a = b = 1)

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 3 (2023 Mock - Exponential):**

An object is heated until it reaches a temperature of T₀°C. It is then allowed to cool. Its temperature, T°C, when it has been cooled for n minutes, is given by the equation T = 33 + 12e^(-3n/4).

(i) Find the value of T₀. [1]
(ii) Find the value of n when T = 37°C. [1]
(iii) Find the value of n at which the rate of decrease of temperature is 0.67°C/minute. [1]
(iv) Explain why the temperature of the object is always greater than 33°C. [1]
(v) Sketch the graph of T = 33 + 12e^(-3n/4). [1]

**Answers:**

(i) T₀ = 45°C (substitute n = 0)

(ii) n = 1.46
    - 37 = 33 + 12e^(-3n/4)
    - e^(-3n/4) = 1/3
    - n = 1.46

(iii) n = 3.46
     - dT/dn = 12(-3/4)e^(-3n/4) = -9e^(-3n/4)
     - -0.67 = -9e^(-3n/4)
     - n = 3.46

(iv) Since 12e^(-3n/4) > 0 for all n, T = 33 + 12e^(-3n/4) > 33

(v) Exponential decay curve starting at (0, 45), approaching horizontal asymptote y = 33

## LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

### Definition
```
If aˣ = b then logₐ b = x
where a > 0, a ≠ 1, b > 0
```

### Special Logarithms
- **Common logarithm**: log₁₀ x = lg x
- **Natural logarithm**: logₑ x = ln x

## LAWS OF LOGARITHMS

```
logₐ(PQ) = logₐ P + logₐ Q

logₐ(P/Q) = logₐ P - logₐ Q

logₐ(Pᵇ) = b logₐ P

logₐ a = 1

logₐ 1 = 0
```

### Change of Base Rule

    - Convert all to base 4
    - log₄(2y) = log₄(y-3)/2 + 3/2
    - 2log₄(2y) = log₄(y-3) + 3
    - log₄[(2y)²/(y-3)] = 3
    - 4y²/(y-3) = 64
    - y² - 16y + 48 = 0
    - (y-4)(y-12) = 0
    - y = 4 or y = 12

(iii) OC_max = 10√109 cm when θ = 16.7°

(iv) θ = 56.7°
     - 80 = 10√109 cos(θ - 16.7°)
     - cos(θ - 16.7°) = 8/√109
     - θ = 56.7°

# CHAPTER 9: COORDINATE GEOMETRY IN 2D

## STRAIGHT LINES

### Gradient (Slope)
```
m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = rise/run
```

### Forms of Linear Equations

#### Gradient-Intercept Form
```
y = mx + c
where m = gradient, c = y-intercept
```

#### Point-Gradient Form
```
y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
where m = gradient, (x₁, y₁) is a point on line
```

#### General Form
```
ax + by + c = 0
```

### Special Lines
- **Vertical line**: x = k (undefined gradient)
- **Horizontal line**: y = k (gradient = 0)

## PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES

### Parallel Lines
```
If lines are parallel: m₁ = m₂
```

### Perpendicular Lines
```
If lines are perpendicular: m₁ × m₂ = -1
or m₂ = -1/m₁
```

## INTERSECTION OF LINES

To find intersection point:
1. Solve equations simultaneously
2. Solution is (x, y) coordinates

## MIDPOINT OF LINE SEGMENT

```
Midpoint = ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2)
```

## DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS

```
Distance = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
```

## AREA OF RECTILINEAR FIGURE

**Shoelace Formula:** For polygon with vertices (x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂), ..., (xₙ,yₙ)

```
Area = ½|Σ(xᵢyᵢ₊₁ - xᵢ₊₁yᵢ)|
```

## CIRCLES

### Standard Form
```
(x-a)² + (y-b)² = r²
where (a,b) is center, r is radius
```

### General Form
```
x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0

Center: (-g, -f)
Radius: √(g² + f² - c)
```

### Finding Circle Properties
From general form x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0:
- Convert to standard form by completing square
- Center = (-g, -f)
- Radius = √(g² + f² - c)

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

**Question 7 (2023 Mock - Circle):**

The equation of the tangent to a circle at the point A(8, 9) is given by 4y + 3x = 60. The line y = 4x - 7 passes through the centre, P, of the circle.

(a) Find the coordinates of P. [2]
(b) Find the equation of the circle. [2]
The tangent to the circle at A meets the y-axis at point B.
(c) Find the equation of another circle with BP as diameter. [2]

**Answers:**

(a) P(2, 1)
    - Tangent: y = -3x/4 + 15, so m_tangent = -3/4
    - Normal: m_normal = 4/3
    - Normal equation: y = 4x/3 - 5/3
    - Solving with y = 4x - 7: x = 2, y = 1
    - P(2, 1)

(b) (x - 2)² + (y - 1)² = 100
    - Substitute A(8, 9): r² = 100
    - Equation: (x - 2)² + (y - 1)² = 100

(c) (x - 1)² + (y - 8)² = 50
    - When x = 0 in tangent: y = 15, so B(0, 15)
    - Centre of new circle: midpoint of BP = (1, 8)
    - Radius = BP/2 = 10√2/2 = 5√2
    - Equation: (x - 1)² + (y - 8)² = 50

**Question 8 (2023 Mock - Linear Law):**

A cup of hot coffee was put on the table to cool at 3 pm. The temperature of the coffee, T°C, after x minutes, is given T = 20 + ae^(-kx) where a and k are constants. [Total 7 marks - see exam paper for full details]

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- Two points determine a unique line

# CHAPTER 11: DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION

## DIFFERENTIATION

### The Derivative as Limit
```
f'(x) = lim[h→0] [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h
```

### Rules of Differentiation

#### Power Rule
```
If f(x) = xⁿ, then f'(x) = nxⁿ⁻¹
```

#### Constant Multiple Rule
```
If f(x) = kx, then f'(x) = k
```

#### Sum/Difference Rule
```
If f(x) = u(x) ± v(x), then
f'(x) = u'(x) ± v'(x)
```

#### Chain Rule
```
If y = f(u) and u = g(x), then
dy/dx = (dy/du) × (du/dx)

Or: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)
```

#### Product Rule
```
If y = uv, then
dy/dx = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)

Or: (uv)' = u'v + uv'
```

#### Quotient Rule
```
If y = u/v, then
dy/dx = [v(du/dx) - u(dv/dx)]/v²

Or: (u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v²
```

### Derivatives of Special Functions

#### Exponential Functions
```
d/dx(eˣ) = eˣ
d/dx(eᵃˣ) = aeᵃˣ
```

#### Logarithmic Functions
```
d/dx(ln x) = 1/x
d/dx(ln(ax + b)) = a/(ax + b)
```

#### Trigonometric Functions
```
d/dx(sin x) = cos x
d/dx(cos x) = -sin x
d/dx(tan x) = sec²x
```

## APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

### Stationary Points

#### Finding Stationary Points
1. Solve f'(x) = 0
2. Substitute back to find y-coordinates

#### Nature of Stationary Points

**Second Derivative Test:**
```
If f'(a) = 0:
  f''(a) < 0 → local maximum at x = a
  f''(a) > 0 → local minimum at x = a
  f''(a) = 0 → test inconclusive
```

**First Derivative Test:**
```
Maximum: f' changes from + to -
Minimum: f' changes from - to +
```

### Tangents and Normals

#### Tangent at Point (x₁, y₁)
```
Gradient: m = f'(x₁)
Equation: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
```

#### Normal at Point (x₁, y₁)
```
Gradient: -1/m = -1/f'(x₁)
Equation: y - y₁ = (-1/m)(x - x₁)
```

### Increasing/Decreasing Functions
```
f'(x) > 0: f is increasing
f'(x) < 0: f is decreasing
```

### Optimization Problems
1. Define variable to optimize
2. Express as function of one variable
3. Find derivative
4. Set derivative = 0
5. Solve for critical points
6. Verify maximum/minimum
7. Answer question in context

### Kinematics

#### Relationships
```
s = displacement
v = ds/dt = velocity
a = dv/dt = d²s/dt² = acceleration

v = ∫a dt
s = ∫v dt
```

#### Distance vs Displacement
```
Displacement = ∫ᵃᵇ v dt
Distance = ∫ᵃᵇ |v| dt
```

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS - DIFFERENTIATION

**Question 11 (2023 Mock - Tangent and Normal):**

The equation of a curve is y = a/x + bx - 1, where a and b are constants. The normal to the curve at the point Q(1, -1) is parallel to the line 4y - x = 20. This normal meets the curve again at point P.

(i) Find the value of a and of b. [4]
(ii) Find the coordinates of point P. [2]

**Answers:**

(i) a = 2, b = -2
    - Normal gradient = 1/4, so tangent gradient = -4
    - dy/dx = -a/x² + b
    - At (1, -1): -a + b = -4 ... (1)
    - Substitute (1, -1): a + b = 0 ... (2)
    - Solving: a = 2, b = -2

(ii) P(-8/9, -53/36)
     - Normal equation: y = x/4 - 5/4
     - Curve: y = 2/x - 2x - 1
     - Solving: 9x² - x - 8 = 0
     - x = -8/9 or x = 1
     - P(-8/9, -53/36)

**Question 12 (2023 Mock - Rate of Change):**

The equation of a curve is given by y = ln√(5x/(9x+4)).

(i) Find dy/dx, expressing it as a single fraction. [2]
(ii) Find the rate at which x is changing when the graph crosses the x-axis, given that y is increasing at a rate of 0.3 units per second. [2]

**Answers:**

(i) dy/dx = 2/[x(9x+4)]

(ii) dx/dt = 3/4 units per second
     - When y = 0: x = -1
     - dy/dt = (dy/dx)(dx/dt)
     - 0.3 = [2/(-1)(-5)](dx/dt)
     - dx/dt = 3/4

**Question 13 (2023 Mock - Maxima & Minima):**

Car B is 48 km due east of Car A. Both cars start moving at the same time. Car A travels due north at 110 km/h while Car B travels due west at 90 km/h.

(i) Express L (distance between cars) in the form √[pt² + (q - rt)²]. [2]
(ii) Find the stationary value of L. [2]
(iii) Determine whether this is maximum or minimum. [2]

**Answers:**

(i) L = √[12100t² + (48 - 90t)²]

(ii) L = 37.1 km at t = 0.214 hours
     - dL/dt = (40400t - 8640)/(2L)
     - Setting dL/dt = 0: t = 108/505
     - L = 37.1 km

(iii) Minimum (using first derivative test)

    (i) ln(cos 2x) [2]
    (ii) (x/2)tan 2x [2]

(b) Using your results from part (a), find ∫2x sec²2x dx. [2]

**Answers:**

(a)(i) -2tan 2x

(a)(ii) x sec²2x + (1/2)tan 2x

(b) ∫2x sec²2x dx = x tan 2x + (1/2)ln cos 2x + c

**Question 15 (2023 Mock - Area Under Graph):**

(a) M is the point of intersection of y = x and y = -x² + 3x. Show that the coordinates of M is (2, 2). [2]

(b) Find the area P, bounded by the curve y = -x² + 3x and the line y = x. [3]

(c) Find the area Q, enclosed by the curve x = y² - 4y and the y-axis. [2]

**Answers:**

(a) x = -x² + 3x
    x² - 2x = 0
    x = 0 or x = 2
    When x = 2, y = 2, so M(2, 2) ✓

(b) Area P = 1⅓ square units
    - ∫₀²(-x² + 2x)dx
    - = [-x³/3 + x²]₀²
    - = 4/3 square units

(c) Area Q = 10⅔ square units
    - y = 0 or y = 4 (x-intercepts)
    - |∫₀⁴(y² - 4y)dy|
    - = 10⅔ square units

**Question 16 (2023 Mock - Kinematics):**

A particle starts from rest, travels in a straight line so that t is the time in seconds after passing a fixed point O. Its velocity, v m/s, is given by v = 6t - 2t². The particle comes to instantaneous rest at A.

(i) Find the acceleration of the particle at A. [2]
(ii) Find the maximum velocity of the particle. [2]
(iii) Find the total distance travelled by the particle during the first 5 seconds. [3]

**Answers:**

(i) a = -6 m/s²
    - At A: v = 0, so t = 3
    - a = dv/dt = 6 - 4t
    - At t = 3: a = -6 m/s²

(ii) v_max = 4.5 m/s
     - For max: dv/dt = 0
     - 6 - 4t = 0, t = 1.5
     - v = 6(1.5) - 2(1.5)² = 4.5 m/s

(iii) Total distance = 17⅔ m
      - s = ∫v dt = 3t² - (2/3)t³
      - At t = 3: s = 9 m
      - At t = 5: s = -8⅓ m
      - Total distance = 9 + |−8⅓ - 9| = 17⅔ m

## THINGS TO REMEMBER
- Always include "+ C" for indefinite integrals
- No "+ C" for definite integrals
- Check answer by differentiating
- Always sketch region first
