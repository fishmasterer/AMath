    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "The line passing through $(2, 1)$ is perpendicular to the line $3x - 2y = 5$. Find the equation of this line in the form $ax + by = c$.",
      "options": [
        "$2x + 3y = 7$",
        "$3x + 2y = 8$",
        "$2x - 3y = 1$",
        "$3x - 2y = 4$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "Gradient of $3x - 2y = 5$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$. Perpendicular gradient: $-\\frac{2}{3}$. Using $y - 1 = -\\frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$: $3y - 3 = -2x + 4$, so $2x + 3y = 7$."

        "$k = 14$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 7,
      "explanation": "Gradient of $AB = \\frac{6-2}{4-1} = \\frac{4}{3}$. For collinearity, gradient of $AC$ must equal gradient of $AB$: $\\frac{k-2}{7-1} = \\frac{4}{3}$, so $\\frac{k-2}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}$, thus $3(k-2) = 24$ and $k = 10$."

        "$x^2 + y^2 = 25$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "Circle equation: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ where center is $(h,k)$ and radius is $r$. So $(x-2)^2 + (y-(-3))^2 = 5^2$, giving $(x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 25$."

      ],
      "correctAnswers": ["A", "B", "C"],
      "partialCredit": true,
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "For tangency: distance from center $(0,0)$ to line $mx - y + c = 0$ equals radius. Distance $= \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2+1}} = 5$, so $c^2 = 25(m^2+1)$ ✓. Line intersects at exactly one point ✓. Option D is incorrect."

        "$y^2 = 12x$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 7,
      "explanation": "Distance from $P(x,y)$ to $(3,0)$: $\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + y^2}$. Distance from $P$ to y-axis: $|x|$. Setting equal: $(x-3)^2 + y^2 = x^2$. Expanding: $x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = x^2$, thus $y^2 = 6x - 9$."
