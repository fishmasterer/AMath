      "question": "In a triangle $ABC$, if $AB = AC$, what can we conclude about the angles?",
      "options": [
        "$\\angle B = \\angle C$",
        "$\\angle A = \\angle B$",
        "$\\angle A = \\angle C$",
        "All angles are equal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 3,
      "explanation": "In an isosceles triangle, the base angles (opposite to the equal sides) are equal. Since $AB = AC$, angles $B$ and $C$ are the base angles, so $\\angle B = \\angle C$."
    },

      "question": "If two angles of a triangle are $50°$ and $60°$, what is the third angle?",

        "$70°$",
        "$80°$",
        "$90°$",
        "$100°$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 2,
      "explanation": "The sum of angles in a triangle is $180°$. Third angle $= 180° - 50° - 60° = 70°$."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 3,
      "explanation": "In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Since $A$ and $C$ are opposite angles, $\\angle C = \\angle A = 70°$."

        "Trapezium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 2,
      "explanation": "A quadrilateral with all four sides equal is a rhombus. A square has equal sides AND equal angles (all $90°$), which is not necessarily the case here."

      "partialCredit": true,
      "marks": 4,
      "explanation": "In a rectangle: opposite sides are equal ✓, all angles are $90°$ ✓, diagonals are equal ✓. However, not all sides are equal (that would be a square) ✗."

      "correctAnswer": "A",

      "explanation": "By the circle theorem, any angle inscribed in a semicircle (with the diameter as the base) is always a right angle ($90°$)."
