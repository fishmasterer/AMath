    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "In triangle $ABC$, $D$ and $E$ are points on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively such that $DE \\parallel BC$. If $AD = 4$, $DB = 6$, and $AE = 6$, find $EC$.",
      "options": [
        "$9$",
        "$8$",
        "$10$",
        "$12$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 7,
      "explanation": "By the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), if $DE \\parallel BC$, then $\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AE}{EC}$. So $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{6}{EC}$, giving $4 \\times EC = 36$, thus $EC = 9$."

      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "Two circles with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $B$. If $O_1A = 5$, $O_2A = 7$, and $O_1O_2 = 8$, what type of triangle is $O_1AO_2$?",

        "Scalene",
        "Isosceles",
        "Equilateral",
        "Right-angled"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "The triangle $O_1AO_2$ has sides $5$, $7$, and $8$. Since all three sides are different, it is a scalene triangle. Check: $5^2 + 7^2 = 25 + 49 = 74 \\neq 64 = 8^2$, so not right-angled."

      "question": "A tangent from an external point $P$ touches a circle at $T$. If $PT = 12$ and the radius of the circle is $5$, find the distance from $P$ to the center $O$.",

        "$13$",
        "$12$",
        "$17$",
        "$7$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 7,
      "explanation": "The radius $OT$ is perpendicular to the tangent $PT$ at the point of contact. So triangle $OTP$ is right-angled at $T$. Using Pythagoras: $PO^2 = PT^2 + OT^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 144 + 25 = 169$, so $PO = 13$."

      "question": "In the diagram, $AB$ is a diameter of the circle, and $C$ is a point on the circumference. $D$ is a point on $AC$ such that $BD \\perp AC$. Which of the following are true? (Select all that apply)",
      "options": [
        "$\\angle ACB = 90°$ (angle in semicircle)",
        "$BD$ is the altitude from $B$ in triangle $ABC$",

      ],
      "correctAnswers": ["A", "B", "D"],
      "partialCredit": true,
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "Since $AB$ is a diameter, $\\angle ACB = 90°$ ✓. $BD \\perp AC$ makes $BD$ an altitude ✓. In right triangle $ABC$, $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$ by Pythagoras ✓. Triangles $ABD$ and $CBD$ are not necessarily similar ✗."

      "question": "Prove that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. In triangle $ABC$ with midpoints $D$ on $AB$ and $E$ on $AC$, if $BC = 10$, find $DE$.",
      "options": [
        "$5$",
        "$10$",
        "$7.5$",
        "$2.5$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "By the midpoint theorem, the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to half its length. So $DE = \\frac{1}{2} BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5$."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "In a circle, two chords $AB$ and $CD$ are equidistant from the center. If $AB = 16$ cm, find the length of $CD$.",
      "options": [
        "$16$ cm",
        "$8$ cm",
        "$12$ cm",
        "$32$ cm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 7,
      "explanation": "A circle theorem states that chords equidistant from the center are equal in length. Since $AB$ and $CD$ are equidistant from the center, $CD = AB = 16$ cm."

      "id": 7,

      "question": "Two circles with radii $3$ and $5$ have centers $10$ units apart. How many common tangents do they have?",

        "$2$ (both external)",
        "$1$ (one external)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 8,
      "explanation": "Distance between centers $= 10$. Sum of radii $= 3 + 5 = 8$. Difference of radii $= 5 - 3 = 2$. Since distance $(10) >$ sum of radii $(8)$, the circles are completely separate and do not intersect. For two separate non-intersecting circles, there are always 4 common tangents: 2 external (transverse) common tangents and 2 internal (direct) common tangents."
