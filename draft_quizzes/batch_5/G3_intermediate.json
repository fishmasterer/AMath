      "question": "In triangle $ABC$, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$. If $AB = AC$, prove that $AD \\perp BC$. Which property is most directly used?",
      "options": [
        "In an isosceles triangle, the median from the vertex angle is perpendicular to the base",

        "Angle sum of triangle",
        "SAS congruence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 5,
      "explanation": "Since $AB = AC$ (isosceles) and $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $AD$ is the median from the vertex angle. A key property of isosceles triangles is that the median from the vertex angle is also the perpendicular bisector of the base."

      "question": "Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ have $AB = DE$, $BC = EF$, and $\\angle B = \\angle E$. By which congruence criterion are they congruent?",
      "options": [
        "SAS (Side-Angle-Side)",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 4,
      "explanation": "We have two sides and the included angle equal: $AB = DE$ (side), $\\angle B = \\angle E$ (angle), $BC = EF$ (side). This is the SAS criterion."

      "question": "In a circle with center $O$, chord $AB$ subtends an angle of $60°$ at the center. What angle does it subtend at a point $C$ on the major arc?",
      "options": [
        "$30°$",
        "$60°$",
        "$120°$",
        "$90°$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "By the circle theorem, the angle subtended by a chord at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference (in the major arc). So $\\angle ACB = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60° = 30°$."

        "$12$"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 6,
      "explanation": "By the intersecting chords theorem: $AP \\times PB = CP \\times PD$. So $4 \\times 6 = 3 \\times PD$, giving $24 = 3 \\times PD$, thus $PD = 8$."

      "marks": 5,
      "explanation": "In similar triangles: corresponding angles are equal ✓, corresponding sides are in the same ratio ($2:3$) ✓, perimeters are in the same ratio ($2:3$) ✓, areas are in the ratio of the square of the sides ($4:9$) ✓."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "marks": 5,
      "explanation": "In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary (sum to $180°$). So $\\angle A + \\angle C = 180°$, giving $\\angle C = 180° - 80° = 100°$."
